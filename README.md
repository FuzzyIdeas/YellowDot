###### Hide the macOS yellow recording dot in the corner of your screen

Inspired by [undot by s4y](https://github.com/s4y/undot)

## macOS 12.2 compatibility

Since macOS 12.2, the dot is no longer a simple window that can be moved away. 

Removing the dot in 12.2 and later requires altering system files, which I wouldn't want to do.

[Tyshawn Cormier](https://github.com/cormiertyshawn895) came up with a very clever solution for this in his [RecordingIndicatorUtility](https://github.com/cormiertyshawn895/RecordingIndicatorUtility) app. Check it out if you still want to hide the dot!
