###### Hide the macOS yellow recording dot in the corner of your screen

## v2 (after macOS 13)

*[available here](https://github.com/FuzzyIdeas/YellowDot/releases)*

Hides the recording or location indicator dot by making it full black or white.

Works best in fullscreen situations on MacBooks with a notch where the black dot would sit on a black menubar making it completely invisible.

In other situations it helps by making the dot blend in with the other menubar icons, making it less of a distraction.

## v1 (before macOS 12.2)

*[available here](https://github.com/FuzzyIdeas/YellowDot/releases/tag/v1)*

Inspired by [undot by s4y](https://github.com/s4y/undot) which grabs and moves the dot window outside the screen.

Since macOS 12.2, the dot is no longer a simple window that can be moved away.

Removing the dot completely in 12.2 and later requires altering system files, which I wouldn't want to do.

[Tyshawn Cormier](https://github.com/cormiertyshawn895) came up with a very clever solution for this in his [RecordingIndicatorUtility](https://github.com/cormiertyshawn895/RecordingIndicatorUtility) app. Check it out if you still want to hide the dot!
